  title: 'THIS IS US'
  content: Hi there! We are PsyCN2None, pronounced as "second to none". We are a small, peer-driven non-profit initiative supporting applicants from Mainland China—especially those facing information gaps—to apply confidently to U.S. Psychology PhD programs. We particularly encourage first-generation students and under-resourced applicants to present themselves with clarity and confidence. Through workshops, resources, and one-on-one guidance, we help you navigate the process from preparation to interviews. If you have any questions feel free to reach out [by email](#contact)! Application for 25-26 cycle is closed. Stay tuned for updates on our next cycle!
